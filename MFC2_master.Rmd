# **Overview**

This is the master document organizing all MFC2 data analyses! Think of this as a data summary + table of contents. Specific analyses will be conducted and figured generated within linked RMarkdown files, acting like chapters. With this file, you can easily locate specific analyses of interest. 

## *Study Design and Main Goals Review*
**MFC2** = "Maternal-Fetal Conflict 2" = 2nd pilot study investigating the role of the gut microbiome in mediating maternal-fetal conflict over gestational energy allocation. 
  
We investigated two main questions in this pilot: 

  1. How do placental lactogen *(PL)* and placental growth hormone *(PGH)* alter the composition of the gut microbiome?

  2. To what extent are the metabolic effects of each hormone dependent on the presence of a gut microbiome?  

Here's an unpolished schematic overview of the study design: 
```{r Study Design, fig.asp=1, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("figures", "MFC2_study_design_schematic.png"))

``` 
 
* We had six different groups spread out over two arms. In the first arm, we had groups for mice receiving each of the two hormones, as well as a group of mice injected with saline as the control group.
  + This allows to target our first question and assess the effect of each hormone on gut microbiome composition using fecal samples taken over the course of the experiment. 

* Our second experimental arm used mice that received high doses of antibiotics (enrofloxacin + ampicillin) in their drinking water to knock down the gut microbiome. This allowed us to see the effects of each hormone on metabolism in mice with a typical gut microbiome and those with a greatly reduced microbial load.
  + This allows us to identify what, if any, of the metabolic effects of these hormones might occur through interactions with the gut microbiome.
